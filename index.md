I am a PhD student in the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the university of Rochester, where I am advised by Dr. Martina Poletti. I am interested in understanding visual attentional mechanisms when multiple competing high-salient stimuli are presented during a task. More specifically, I am working on addressing the question "how do we selectively process the most relevant sensory information and optimally allocate our visual resources to relevant stimuli when there are distracting salient items in the visual field?". On the flip side of this, I am also interested in understanding vision and its deficits in patient population specifically, Schizophrenia.
