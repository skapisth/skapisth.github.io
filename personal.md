## __Wanderlust!__
That so called "travel bug" bit me at a very young age. From India to the States to Europe, I made the most out of my opportunities. I used pretty much all my holidays to travel, explore cultures and cuisines. I have wandered around some wonderful countries around the world covering many cities. I made sure to get myself a toy that could help me in saving my memories somewhere apart from my brain. You can see me making memories  <a href = "https://www.flickr.com/photos/159618694@N08/albums" target="_blank"> here. </a>
    
## __Kids!__
Because I enjoy being around kids, summer 2017 I decided to work part-time at Margaret's House. It's RIT's Day Care for little kids. While I enjoyed playing with kids there, I was given an opportunity to represent India as part of their Kids on Campus Program. It's a program for kids between ages 8-12 where they are taught various things. As part of this, I shared India's culture, history and our way of living life everyday. Look  <a href = "https://www.flickr.com/photos/159618694@N08/albums/72157669226813777" target="_blank"> here </a> to see what these amazing little kids gave me the next day I went to school :). I loved every bit of this summer. 

## __Me!__
Apart from these, I enjoy being outdoors. I have a cat that I adopted during covid. because I could no longer travel, I trained my cat "Miles" to go on adventures with me on a leash. I do Triathlons every year and I am currently training for this years race in August. I am hiking to the Mt. Everest Basecamp this September.
