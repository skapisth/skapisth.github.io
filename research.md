I am working on many projects as part of my graduate school curriculum. All of these projects use our laboratory's custom built digital dual-purkinje image eye-tracker. The outcome of these projects have wide range of applications from foveated rendering in virtual reality systems to treatment dignosis in patient populations. Read below for detailed information about these projects.

### __Individual project__

## __Spatio-temporal dynamics of foveal visual search__
This project looked at how oculomotor behavior and performance changes in a foveal task in the presence of a salient distractor. I designed and developed the task using c++, collected data from 9 naive participants. Results suggest that both oculomotor behavior and performance are not impacted by saliency. We also found that if there is task-relevant non-salient distractor, oculomotor behavior is significantly impacted while performance is not. This work has been presented as a poster at VSS 2020 and ECVP 2021 and is currently in progress for a manuscript publication.

## __Temporal modulations of extrafoveal sensitivity to changes during fixation__
This project looked at how sensitivity changes over time in a covert peripheral discrimination task
during fixation and upon saccade landing and how salient distractors effected this temporal sensitivity. I designed and devloped this task using c++, collected data from 12 naive paticipants. Results show that subjects' ability to discriminate the direction of sudden orientation changes was best right after the stimulus onset and upon saccade landing (0-150 ms) and it decreased over time during the course of fixation. On average, performance dropped by 17% around 350 ms. Importantly, the perceptual salience of the surrounding did not influence performance, suggesting that in this task the visual system is capable of actively suppressing salient distractors at no cost. Presented this work as a poster at vss 2022. Currently working on acquiring more data and look into more analysis.

## __Temporal modulations of extra-foveal sensitivity in the presence of a complex foveal task__
This project looks at how visual sensitivity changes over time in a covert peripheral discrimination task
while there is a simultaneous complex foveal task at the center. This task was also designed and developed by me using c++. This is currently in pilot stage with data from 3 naive subjects. 

## __Fixational eye movements (FEM) in patients with Scizophrenia and their contributions to abnormal vision__
This project looks at FEMs in schizophrenia population and age matched controls. I am involved in data collection and data analysis on two already existing lab experiments. The aim of this project is to first understand if FEMs contribute to vision deficits in schizophrenia. Any link between FEMs and their vision deficits could potentially lead to bio markers that can be used to diagnose the disease onset and progression. We currently have very interesting preliminary results from 3 patients and 5 controls. Reach out to me via email if you want to learn more.
