I am working on many projects as part of my graduate school curriculum. Read below for detailed information about these projects.

## __Spatio-temporal dynamics of foveal visual search__
This project looked at how oculomotor behavior and performance changes in a foveal task in the presence of a salient distractor. I designed and developed the task using c++, collected data from 9 naive participants. Results suggest that both oculomotor behavior and performance are not impacted by saliency. We also found that if there is task-relevant non-salient distractor, oculomotor behavior is significantly impacted while performance is not. This work has been presented at VSS 2020 and ECVP 2021. This work is currently in progress for a manuscript publication.
